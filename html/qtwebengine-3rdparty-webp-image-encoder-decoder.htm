Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to

infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these

for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such
